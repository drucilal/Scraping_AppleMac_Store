Overview 
--------

There has been an increasing use of Apple devices in the workplace.
From tech companies to health care fields, Apple devices have increased in productivity and has made the workload easier for employees. Todays’ laptop market has been partitioned by both  Windows and Apple.
The Mac Apple Application store provides users with a variety of apps that can be beneficial to them in their professional field. As a start in beginning to enhance my knowledge in the market research field, I have decided to explore seven apps genres in the Mac App Store. 
This approach can be beneficial in businesses when developing the next app that lies within these seven genres ( Education, Business, Medical, Photography, Graphics & Design, Music, Video). 
Instead of solely relying on the internet for information on different applications, I scraped the Apple Mac App Store into a dataset and began visualizing it through an exploratory data analysis approach. 

Information Extracted: 
----------------------
Name, Size (GB, KB, MB), App Category, Languagues, App Rating (0-5), Price

Cleaning

Data Analysis & Visualization 
-----------------------------

  Educational apps tend to be the most predominant. Apple sells their Laptops/Ipad at a discounted rate for current students.

Size: 
-----

1. Graphic Design consumes the largest power of apps, while business applications consume the least computation power.

2. We can see that each of the seven categories contains applications that vary within size.

3. Based on users’ memory capacity, they are able to choose which application is best for them to use.

Price
-----
1. Majority of applications are not free.

2. I picked the top ten most expensive apps in each category and compared their price ranges to the others.

3. Majority of the paid apps are graphic and design applications. It seems to be that the applications that consumed the most computational power were not free.

 4.These are apps are also the most expensive ones. 

5. Majority of educational applications are free.  Individuals are offered free resources to enhance their knowledge in their educational field. 

Ratings 
-------
1.Applications within the 7 categories contain more highly rated applications except for business applications. 

Conclusion
----------
  Users within these seven professional fields have a variety of applications to choose from. Graphics and Design appeared to be the category that consumes the most memory power, tends to be the most expensive, and contains an average rating.

  On the other hand, educational applications are at little to no cost and consume less computational power. After visualizing all of this information, it is fair to predict that both education and graphics & design applications are benefiting the apple market. As new applications are formed, an increase in profits is likely to occur.
  
Future Work: 
------------
 - Scraping the total ratings
 - Scraping the Windows Application store and comparing its features to Apple
