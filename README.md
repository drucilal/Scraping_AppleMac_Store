# Scraping_AppleMac_Store

Description 

There has been an increasing use of Apple devices in the workplace.
From tech companies to health care fields, Apple devices have increased in productivity and has made the workload easier for employees. Todaysâ€™ laptop market has been partitioned by both  Windows and Apple.
The Mac Apple Application store provides users with a variety of apps that can be beneficial to them in their professional field. As a start in beginning to enhance my knowledge in the market research field, I have decided to explore seven apps genres in the Mac App Store. 
This approach can be beneficial in businesses when developing the next app that lies within these seven genres ( Education, Business, Medical, Photography, Graphics & Design, Music, Video). 
Instead of solely relying on the internet for information on different applications, I scraped the Apple Mac App Store into a dataset and began visualizing it through an exploratory data analysis approach.
